The data and analysis script from the article "Changes in the prevalence of mental health problems during the first year of the pandemic"

The folder "in" contains the data (outcomes and metadata). 
Open and run the file MASTER file MHCOVID dichotomous analysis of longitudinal data.R
This calls other scripts (for data cleaning and analysis) and produces results. 

The two .Rmd files produce the results section and the Appendix in the publication.
